GENERAL / ARCHITECTURE
Unify or refactor the “Bot” logic (avoid duplication between bot.py and chess_server.py)
Standardize board representation (dictionary vs. 2D array)
Resolve 0-based vs. 1-based indexing inconsistencies
BOT.PY
Add handling for special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)
Refine the evaluation function (currently only material-based)
Integrate the bot logic more closely with the main game (avoid isolated code)
CHESS_CLIENT.PY
Implement the menu logic fully (Play, Ask AI, Maintain data, Exit)
Hook up user input to actual functions in chess_server.py (or elsewhere)
Provide user feedback and error handling for invalid inputs
CHESS_SERVER.PY
Finish King logic (two separate get_legal_moves methods, incomplete castling checks)
Implement is_checkmate (currently a placeholder)
Clean up castling checks to ensure squares are not attacked
Resolve repeated or conflicting Bot logic (there is also a Bot class in bot.py)
Finalize the Game class (currently references pygame, partial UI code)
KEYWORDS.PY
Decide whether to generate and use chessboard coordinates (commented-out code)
Ensure data/info.txt is handled safely (file might be missing)
Potentially integrate directly with vectordb.py for consistent data flow
VECTORDB.PY
Clarify usage of RELOAD_DB (maybe a config option instead of a hardcoded True/False)
Potentially store structured chess data (FEN, PGN, etc.) rather than just raw lines
Consider adding more metadata (move number, color, etc.) to documents
Decide on the purpose of main() (currently just a demo)
ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS (OPTIONAL)
Write unit tests (e.g., pytest) for movement logic, checkmate detection, vector DB queries
Replace print statements with a logging library for easier debugging
Expand documentation or create a README to explain code structure
Create a requirements.txt (or pyproject.toml) with dependencies (pygame, loguru, pysnooper, chromadb, transformers, etc.)
Improve error handling (inform users if a move is invalid, file is missing, etc.)
